# Mapping_Earthquakes
### Wisualization of Earthquake data
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

We will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.
Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. 
In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
